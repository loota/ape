Bugs:
  Ship can fly reverse inside another object(and also in high speeds it goes through other objects)

  DONE Destroyed ship doesn't end the game

  DONE Enemy isn't destroyed

  Enemies move in a circular motion when player moves in a similar motion


Features:
  Partial collisions with objects, meaning that crashing to the corner of another object makes object bit slower and turns it (surplus.py has some code for it)

  Weapons:
    Guided missiles
    Machinegun
    Spray-gun

  Enemy ships, infantry, armours, more AA

  Terrain

  Random levels

  UI

  LOS

Bad code:
  DONE Loading the images used in game should be implemented by loading all images from a certain directory

  DONE Whole object-hierarchy should be remade( as in object->component->building->groundbattery )

  Proper collision detection

Short-timespan plan:
  Spray-gun
  Guided missiles
  Enemy vessels
  Random levels
  Enemy circle-motion bug
  Proper collision-detection engine
  Reverse flight bug
